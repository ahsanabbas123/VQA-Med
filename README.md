# VQA-Med
Medical Question Answering

Since the release of the first VQA dataset in 2014, additional datasets have been released and many algorithms have been proposed. The dataset examined here is VQA-Med, based on images from the MedPix database with only the cases where the diagnosis was made based on the image.

Although it has been made sure that the current task would not have answers requiring
external domain knowledge, such a dataset is proposed to be introduced in future
ImageClef VQA tasks. It can prove to be useful in practical applications with
open-ended questions to first learn/use pre-trained embeddings for the medical entities
present in the textual data.
